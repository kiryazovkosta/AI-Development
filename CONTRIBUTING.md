## 🌟 How to Contribute

### Adding a New Project

1. **Choose the Right Category**
   - `learning-projects/` - For educational and experimental projects
   - `practical-projects/` - For production-ready applications

2. **Create Project Structure**
   ```
   project-name/
   ├── README.md
   ├── src/
   ├── requirements.txt or package.json
   └── docs/ (optional)
   ```

3. **Follow the Template**
   - Use `templates/PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md` as a guide for your project README
   - Include clear setup and usage instructions
   - Document dependencies and requirements

4. **Update the Catalog**
   - Add your project to `PROJECT_CATALOG.md`
   - Include all relevant information (name, description, technologies, date, status)

### Code Quality Standards

- **Documentation**: All code should be well-documented
- **README**: Each project must have a comprehensive README.md
- **Dependencies**: Clearly specify all dependencies
- **AI Generation**: Indicate if code was AI-generated and which AI tool was used
- **Testing**: Include tests where applicable

### Project README Requirements

Every project should have a README.md with:
- Project title and description

## 🤖 AI Generation Best Practices

When adding AI-generated projects:

1. **Credit the AI**: Mention which AI tool generated the code
2. **Review and Test**: Don't blindly commit AI-generated code
3. **Document Limitations**: Note any known issues or limitations
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Feel free to improve AI-generated code
